# Problem Solving Agent Using Search

## Objective: 
Design a robotic vacuum agent to find and stop at the dirtiest spot in a 2D grid using intelligent search techniques.

## Key Features:

1. Environment: Fully observable, deterministic, single-agent, sequential, static, discrete.

2. PEAS Model: Performance (maximize dirt collected, minimize moves), Environment (2D room grid), Actuators (wheels), Sensors (dirt detectors).

## Algorithms Used:

1. Iterative Deepening A* (Optimal global solution using heuristics)

2. Hill Climbing (Fast local solution)

## Tools & Techniques:

1. Heuristics based on Manhattan Distance

2. Priority Queues, Sets for efficient search

3. Complexity analysis and performance evaluation

## Outcome:
Efficient and intelligent navigation to locate the dirtiest spot with minimal energy consumption.
