# Problem-Solving-Agent-Using-Search

Objective:
Design a robotic vacuum agent to find and stop at the dirtiest spot in a 2D grid using intelligent search techniques.

ðŸ”Ž Key Features:

Environment: Fully observable, deterministic, single-agent, sequential, static, discrete.

PEAS Model: Performance (maximize dirt collected, minimize moves), Environment (2D room grid), Actuators (wheels), Sensors (dirt detectors).

Algorithms Used:

Iterative Deepening A* (Optimal global solution using heuristics)

Hill Climbing (Fast local solution)

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques:

Heuristics based on Manhattan Distance

Priority Queues, Sets for efficient search

Complexity analysis and performance evaluation

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
Efficient and intelligent navigation to locate the dirtiest spot with minimal energy consumption!
