# Problem-Solving-Agent-Using-Search
The project presents the design and implementation of a robotic vacuum cleaner agent that navigates a 2D grid to locate and stop at the dirtiest spot. The agent operates in a fully observable, single-agent, deterministic, sequential, static, and discrete environment.
